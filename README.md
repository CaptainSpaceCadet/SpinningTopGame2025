# Setup Unity Project
This project uses this [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/j-mai/4389f587a079cb9f9f07602e4444a6ed) for setting up the Unity Project git source control.
1. **Step 1** can be skipped as the _.gitignore_ is tracked in the repository
2. **Step 2** can probably be skipped as project setting I believe are tracked in the reporsitory, but you should double-check
3. For **Step 3**, the _.gitattributes_ is tracked in the repository so no edits are required however you must find the location of _UnityYAMLMerge_ on your local device and add it to your _.git/config_ file as instructed
4. For **Step 4**, the _.gitattributes_ is tracked in the repository so no edits are required however you must install and initialise _Git LFS_ as instructed
